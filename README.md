# Square Game

## Overveiw
This repo describes requirements for the software implementation of the classic game of Square, also known as Dots and Boxes, where players take turns drawing lines between adjacent dots on a grid. The goal is to complete boxes and earn points. This software will allow two players to play against each other. A description of the game plus the requirements of this implementation are provided below.

## The Game
Two players are presented with a 3x3 grid of dots with faded lines between the dots. The players take turns ‘drawing’ lines. When a box is completed (i.e., all sides are connected), it is “claimed” (marked with the players symbol- e.g., X or O). The game ends when all boxes are claimed. The player with the most claimed/completed boxes wins.
